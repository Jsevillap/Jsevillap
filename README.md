## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jesus Sevilla

Iâ€™m a front-end web developer from Colima, Mexico (beautiful small town) I started my career as a graphic designer but I always had a thing for the web and development in general (when I was a kid I wanted to make videogames).

A few years ago I decided I wanted to be a web developer and started learning everything I could and fell in LOVE with web development particularly front-end.

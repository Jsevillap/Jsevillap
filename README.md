## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jesus Sevilla
I'm an aspiring web developer I'm looking to learn something new everyday and grow and improve my skillset so I can create as many projects as I can imagine....
I've been developing sites for a while but never really got into more than just html, css and simple jquery until the last two years and ever since I've been improving a falling in love
with everything web development related, going from just html, css to more advanced javascript, to frameworks, libraries, git, npm, terminal etc... for now it has been great
working on problems and solving them even when they seemed impossible (to me because of my limited knowledge at least) it's one of the most rewarding feelings ever...
